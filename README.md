# Aldebaran

Aldebaran (ALD) is a 16-bit computer with 64kB RAM emulated in Python.

The specs are partly (from a large distance) based on the IBM PC XT. In spite of the totally inefficient technology (namely Python) it reached the blazing speed of 40 kHz on a Macbook Air.

The project is under heavy construction...
